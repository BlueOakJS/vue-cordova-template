# vue-cordova-template

**Important**

For the time being, this template requires a newer version of vue-cli than what has been published on npm.

To get the latest,

`npm i -g https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli.git`

> A full-featured Vue template for Cordova using Webpack build.

## Documentation

- [For this template](http://blueoakjs.github.io/vue-cordova-template): common questions specific to this template are answered and each part is described in greater detail
- [For Vue 2.0](http://vuejs.org/guide/): general information about how to work with Vue, not specific to this template

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

``` bash
$ npm install -g https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli.git
$ vue init blueoakjs/vue-cordova-template my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

If port 8080 is already in use on your machine you must change the port number in `/config/index.js`. Otherwise `npm run dev` will fail.
