# Introduction

This boilerplate is targeted towards large, serious Cordova projects and assumes you are somewhat familiar with Webpack and `vue-loader`. Make sure to also read [`vue-loader`'s documentation](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader/index.html) for common workflow recipes.

## Quickstart

To use this template, scaffold a project with [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

``` bash
$ npm install -g https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli.git
$ vue init blueoakjs/vue-cordova-template my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
